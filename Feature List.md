- Bugs
    - When the enemy is hit, it falls down, but the collosion capsule stays in place until its time to live expires (3 secs), this blocks projectiles, and extends the time to live each time the capsule is hit
    - Similar to the other bug, the capsule still gets hit and counts as a kill 



- Plot
    - Level 1 - Desert
        You start in the desert with a low tech gun. You are protecting a group geochemical scientists secmicly scanning for presious minerals underground on a hostile planet. You have to fend off increasing waves of grunt natives on the surface while the scientists down below do their job. Should take a few minutes. Hopefully none of those worms show up. 
    - Level 2
        You have a new weapon in a new place
